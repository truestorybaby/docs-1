# Networks

Chainstack supports joining the following Polygon zkEVM networks:

* Testnet - public Polygon zkEVM testnet
* Mainnet - public Polygon zkEVM mainnet

For development purposes on the testnet, fund your accounts with [Goerli testnet ether](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de) and bridge them to Polygon zkEVM testnet.
