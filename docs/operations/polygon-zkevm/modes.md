# Modes

Chainstack currently supports deploying a Polygon zkEVM node in the full mode only.

A Polygon zkEVM full node deployed with Chainstack currently stores the full blockchain data and an archive of historical states starting from the chain genesis.

Polygon zkEVM support most of the [JSON-RPC methods](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter) that support querying at a block number. See [Polygon zkEVM documentation](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/blob/develop/docs/json-rpc-endpoints.md) for the full list of supported methods.

Query example to get the balance of an address at different block numbers with ethers.js:

``` js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);
const eth_getBalance = async () => {
    const balance = await provider.send("eth_getBalance", ["YOUR_PUBLIC_ADDRESS", "latest"]);
    console.log(balance);
  };
eth_getBalance();
```
