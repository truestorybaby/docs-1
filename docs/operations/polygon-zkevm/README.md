# Introduction

This section outlines the fundamentals of and operations for Polygon zkEVM.

Deploying a Polygon zkEVM node with Chainstack provides you with a near-instantly fully synchronized Polygon zkEVM node through the use of [Bolt](/glossary/bolt).

Learn about [the supported networks](/operations/polygon-zkevm/networks), [full and archive node modes](/operations/polygon-zkevm/modes), and how to [interact with your node](/operations/polygon-zkevm/tools).
