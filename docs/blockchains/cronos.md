# Cronos

Cronos is an open-source and permissionless, layer-1 Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.

## Consensus

Cronos has the proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus. It operates on a modified version of the [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus whereby validators are vetted by other validators, and are awarded staking tokens based on performance factors. The Cronos consensus is referred to as PoA because new nodes require existing validators to authorize the provision of staking tokens to the new node validators.
