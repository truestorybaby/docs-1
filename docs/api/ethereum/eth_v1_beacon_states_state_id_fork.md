# eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/fork RPC method

Ethereum consensus layer Beacon Chain API call that returns the Fork object for the state with the given `state_id`. See also [Fork object](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#fork) and [fork choice](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/#fork-choice).

**Parameters:**

* `state_id` — `string` — (required) the state identifier with:
  * `head` — the canonical head of the chain in the view of the node that you are sending the call to.
  * `genesis` — the genesis state of the chain.
  * `justified` — the slot in the current epoch that has received [attestations](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attestations/) from two thirds of the Ethereum validators.
  * `finalized` — the previously justified slot that is now in the epoch that is at least immediately previous to the current epoch.
  * `slot` — the slot number.
  * `0xstateRoot` — the root hash for the global chain state after applying changes [in the block](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/) that is in the slot.

**Returns:**

* `data` — `object` — the [Fork](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#fork) object with:
  * `previous_version` — `string` — the fork version number.
  * `current_version` — `string` — the fork version number.
  * `epoch` — `string` — the epoch number.

**Example:**

``` sh
curl -X GET https://beacon-nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d/eth/v1/beacon/states/finalized/fork
